# Genetic-Algorithm
Genetic algorithm for real-valued functions
I implemented a genetic algorithm for a computational statistics project. I tested it on benchmark functions used in optimization (works 👍), image reconstruction (works 👍), and matching for causal inference (results aren't good).

Inspiration: Luca Scrucca, and work by Alexis Diamond and Jasjeet Sekhon on genetic matching.
